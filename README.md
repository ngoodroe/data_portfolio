# Linda Data Project
## by Nathan Goodroe

This is a project from multiple csv all the way through to final findings.

## Python

The first file is the combine.py which is where I took the multiple csv from the Social security administration and was able to put them into one file so that I could then load them into my SQL (Postgres) server and be able to do work on it.

## SQL

Once in Postgres I ran a number of different commands to try and find some interesting things, look for a story in the data and pull out any kind of details that might be of note.

I settled on the name Linda and the story around it.

Those were then exported into their own csvs and subsequently loaded into Tableua for visualizations.

## Tableau

Graphs were made in Tableau and put on a final graphic found at https://public.tableau.com/views/TheHistoryoftheNameLinda/LindaDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Youtube

Then I took the visualizations and explained the foundings at https://youtu.be/tGr4HzKR_co?si=H_qkPSomJ32GtzFc
